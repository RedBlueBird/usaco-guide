<Spoiler title="Hint 1">

Line the apples on a single file, and put children in between the apples.
Now we can represent any distribution of apples by letting each children own one interval of apples.

<Spoiler title="Hint 2">

Now finding all the distribution of apples is same as number of ways to arrange the children inbetween the apples.

## Explanation

To get a more illustrative idea of the given problem, consider $n + m - 1$ white
balls in a row. Of those $n + m - 1$ white balls, $m - 1$ are chosen to be
colored black as separators, which gives us exactly $m$ segments of (possibly
zero) white balls. There are

$$
\binom{n + m - 1}{m - 1}
$$

ways to choose the balls to color black.

The ways to color $m - 1$ balls black corresponds to the ways to distribute
those $n$ apples to $m$ children, since the number of white balls in a segment
corresponds to the number of apples given to a child.

<Info title="Stars and bars">

The given problem is equivalent to finding the number of solutions for the
equation

$$
x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = m.
$$

The method used in this problem is called [Stars and
bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_(combinatorics)).

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

using ll = long long;

const ll MOD = 1e9 + 7;
const int MAXN = 2e6;

vector<ll> fac(MAXN, 1);
vector<ll> inv(MAXN, 1);

ll binpow(ll x, ll n, ll m) {
	x %= m;
	ll res = 1;
	while (n > 0) {
		if (n % 2 == 1) { res = res * x % m; }
		x = x * x % m;
		n /= 2;
	}
	return res;
}

ll binom(int n, int k) { return fac[n] * inv[k] % MOD * inv[n - k] % MOD; }

int main() {
	for (int i = 2; i < MAXN; i++) { fac[i] = i * fac[i - 1] % MOD; }

	inv[MAXN - 1] = binpow(fac[MAXN - 1], MOD - 2, MOD);
	for (int i = MAXN - 2; i > 0; i--) { inv[i] = (i + 1) * inv[i + 1] % MOD; }

	int n, m;
	cin >> n >> m;

	cout << binom(n + m - 1, n - 1) << endl;
}
```
